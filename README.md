Namecheap sabotaged my domain renewal and transfer [because of my nationality](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30504812). **Never** use namecheap. Transfer your domain away from them as fast as you can.


### Why Github?
- I have a personal tech blog, so I assume most of my visitors already have github.
- It has pretty good issues.
- That's it.

### Why not Disqus?
I've used Disqus until recently.
- First of all, Disqus has problems with notification, every comment was a surprise.
- Secondly, Disqus takes a lot time to load and downloads almost 1.4 megabytes (sic!) of gzipped data.
- Thirdly, Disqus requires separate account and authentication.
- Finally, it's simply not **that** great.
